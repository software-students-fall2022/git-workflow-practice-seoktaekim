- This article defines what **software engineers** and **software developers** are. It also differentiates the roles in these two position in a simple manner that is very readable and understandable. I find it very interesting because initially I thought software developers and software engineers and very similar. However, this article shows that there are a variety of distinction between the titles.

- I also wasn't aware that they were actually different roles until reading that article. I guess the main differentiator really goes back to the systematic element in the definitions for Software Engineering that we looked at in class (Shannon Huang)
